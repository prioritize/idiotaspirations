      <description>Self-Improvement; Every year I make New Years resolutions, and I&amp;rsquo;m somewhat successful in holding to them. This year I&amp;rsquo;ve resolved to improve myself by bettering my ability to program. I&amp;rsquo;d say I&amp;rsquo;m middling in my current ability. I rarely find myself incapable of performing a task, but I&amp;rsquo;d rarely say my solutions are the most optimized or clear to read. On another note, I also struggle to sound professional in emails and other written correspondence and I think writing a devlog would help me in that regards.</description>
